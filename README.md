# linear-regression-coursera

This is my implementation of the **Linear Regression practice lab** from Coursera (Andrew Ng, Machine Learning).  
The goal is to predict restaurant profits based on city population using **linear regression with one variable**.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/linear_regression_labipynb` : Jupyter notebook with all code, exercises, and plots.
- `data/` : Contains dataset used in the lab.
- `requirements.txt` : Python dependencies.

## Features

- Compute cost function
- Implement gradient descent
- Visualize convergence and predictions
- Make predictions for new city populations

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/linear-regression-practice.git
cd linear-regression-practice
